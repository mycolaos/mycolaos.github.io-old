What Tailwind does is reducing the decisions you need to make and lowers the cognitive load to minimum.

Most of the styling is basic layout, spacing, font, color.

<div class="mb-4 flex gap-2 text-xl text-red-500">

No need to bother with class names.

No context switching by going back and forth between files, even if you open html and css side by side.

No need to understand the relationship between different classes applied to the same element.

No problems with css specificity.

Much shorter syntax and straight to the point.

Out of the box design system with predefined values. This one is important, because with the "normal" css people end up creating a crap of variables and "reusable" classes that make styling even harder than it already is.

Consistency across projects, one can easily switch from one project to another one.

No dead code, easier maintenance.

Fantastic intellisense, faster to write.

Animations are like functions, so makes sense to put them in a config file.

I worked with css, scss, less, styled components, css-in-js, jss and what else. I really don't see why a reasonable human would ignore all the points I listed and insist on ignoring how much concise and simple Tailwind is.

Fun fact: I actually avoided Tailwind until I tried it.

The best thing to do is to try it for a whole project and see how it works out. If it doesn't work for you, for whatever reason, fine! Maybe share why it didn't work for you, so all of us can see a different perspective.
